Special Thanks

xfce4-namebar-plugin is based on the Namebar applet for gnome-panel by Matias SÃ¤rs. It can be found at the following URL:

Thanks to Matias for his blessings on the project.

And also thanks to:
-The authors of Vala, for a great programming language that brings the power and universality of C to a modern, easy to learn C#-like language.
-The authors of waf for an easy to use, intuitive build system.
-The members of the various IRC channels that helped me on my way with Vala and waf.
-The authors of XFCE for a great desktop environment.
-The authors of the Vala bindings for XFCE, without which this port would not be possible. Well, mayhaps in a different language. But I really like Vala. ;)
